    "I have been using keras and tensorflow for an year and both have been good with few advantages and limitations.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "Keras is high level API built on Theano and tensorflow and is easy to use while tensorflow is a complex one.But in flexibility point of view, TF in much more flexible and offers more advanced operations than keras which comes useful while doing research.\n",
    "*So I then decided to find something which is easy to use, provides the intuition of entire flow control and offers flexibilty of doing advanced operations.*This is where I started to work and fall in love with it.\n",

    "**PyTorch is an Open source Machine Learning library for python, based on Torch.** \n",
    "* **The biggest difference between TF and PYtorch is that, in tensorflow, graph is defined statically before running a model whereas in PyTorch, graph construction is dynamic and nodes can be defined, changed and executed on the go.**\n",
    "* **Building or binding custom extensions written in C, C++ or CUDA is doable with both frameworks. TensorFlow again requires more boiler plate code though is arguably cleaner for supporting multiple types and devices. In PyTorch you simply write an interface and corresponding implementation for each of the CPU and GPU versions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Compiling the extension is also straight-forward with both frameworks and doesn’t require downloading any headers or source code outside of what’s included with the pip installation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focusses on implementing Image classification task using PyTorch using Sequential API. The difference between torch.nn and torch.nn.functional is a matter of convenience and taste. *torch.nn is more convenient for methods which have learnable parameters.*\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "**This tutorial is sufficient to create your first model in PyTorch and learn most of it's concepts and this documentation is very straightforward and descriptive.**\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "Initially, I have noticed people face issues in these issues with pytorch:\n",
    "* **Data Loading**\n",
    "* **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "so I have intended to make these tasks more simpler in this tutorial. This tutorial is sufficient for building your first classifier using PyTorch and optimizing it using your custom data. It is structured in such way that you can get hold of entire pipeline of Image Classification tasks. Just Fork the kernel and execute it sequentially and you will get practical taste of PyTorch.\n",
