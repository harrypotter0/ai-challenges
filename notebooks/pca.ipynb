The goal is to predict the lower half of a sign language digits given its upper half.

When our model learn too much (over fit), we need to avoid it with regularization(penalty). Because, if we do not use regularization data will memorize the training set and cannot predict test set very well. For further information check my machine learning tutorial. For this kernel dop not worried how to implement it, we will use sklearn. https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/machine-learning-tutorial-for-beginners\n    * **What is cross validation:** Cross-validation is a technique to evaluate predictive models by partitioning the original sample into a training set to train the model, and a test set to evaluate it.  \n    <a href=\"http://imgbb.com/\"><img src=\"http://image.ibb.co/mHSdax/19.jpg\" alt=\"19\" border=\"0\"></a>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1594a243e7a70f34b1c9457a3d743ef464e3e841","_cell_guid":"0ba4933e-c77e-4d22-8c57-275e92eb7339"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Our data is sign language digits dataset.\n* Shape of our data is (2062,64,64). \n    * 2062 is number of images.\n    * There are 64x64 pixels.\n* Lets load the data.

I hope it makes more sence for you.\n* Now lets try one more thing. \n* As you remember training time is almost 45 second. I think it is too much time. The reason of this time is number of sample(2062) and number of feature(4096). \n* There is two way to decrease time spend.\n    1. Decrease number of sample that I do no recommend.\n    1. Decrease number of features. As you see from images all signs are in the middle of the frames. Therefore, around signs are same for all signs. <a href=\"http://imgbb.com/\"><img src=\"http://image.ibb.co/nAu55x/20.jpg\" alt=\"20\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    * Think that all of the pixels are feature.
