        "If you want to apply machine learning to image recognition, convolutional neural networks (CNN) is the way to go. It has been sweeping the board in competitions for the last several years, but perhaps its first big success came in the late 90's when [Yann LeCun][1] used it to solve MNIST with 99.5% accuracy. I will show you how it is done in Keras, which is a user-friendly neural network library for python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many other notebooks here use a simple fully-connected network (no convolution) to achieve 96-97%, which is a poor result on this dataset. In contrast, what I will show you here is nearly state-of-the-art. In the Kernel (<20 minutes training) we will achieve 99%, but if you train it overnight (or with a GPU) you should reach 99.5. If you then ensemble over several runs, you should get close to the best published accuracy of 99.77% . (Ignore the 100% results on the leaderboard; they were created by learning the test set through repeat submissions)\n",

It's easy, however, to create a net that overfits, with perfect results on the training set and very poor results on the validation data. If this happens, you could try increasing the Dropout parameters, increase augmentation, or perhaps stop training earlier. If you instead wants to increase accuracy, try adding on two more layers, or increase the number of filters."
